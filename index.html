                            <p>Hello, my name is Harman Singh Sarai and I am currently studying to become a web developer. This site contains information about me, including information about my personal life as well as my professional life.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I was born in Stranraer, Scotland and I now currently live in Glasgow, Scotland. I started studying to become a Full-Stack Engineer in 2022 and have studied HTML, CSS and Javascript. On this page, I will display some of the projects that I have undertaken whilst studying this course. I will add more and more projects as I progress on my learning journey.</p>

                            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
